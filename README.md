# Cat_and_Dog_Classification_Using_CNN
### 1. Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to classify images of dogs and cats using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The dataset used is a popular benchmark in image classification tasks, and the goal is to build a model that can accurately differentiate between the two classes.
### 2. Project Objective
*	To preprocess and analyze the 'Dogs vs. Cats' dataset.
*	To develop a CNN model to classify images of dogs and cats.
*	To evaluate the performance of the model and suggest improvements.
### 3. Data Description
*	Dataset Overview: The dataset is sourced from Kaggle (Dogs vs. Cats).
*	Number of Images: Approximately 25,000 images divided into training and testing sets.
*	Classes: Two classes - Dogs and Cats.
*	Image Dimensions: 256x256 pixels.
### 4. Data Pre-processing Steps and Inspiration
*	Data Extraction: Extracted images from the downloaded zip file.
*	Image Augmentation: Used image dataset generators for training and validation datasets.
*	Normalization: Scaled pixel values to the range [0, 1] for better model performance.
### 5. Data Insights
*	The dataset is balanced with an equal number of images for both classes.
*	Images were resized to a standard dimension of 256x256 pixels.
*	Normalization was applied to ensure consistent input values for the model.
### 6. Choosing the Algorithm for the Project
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was chosen for this image classification task due to its proven effectiveness in handling visual data.
### 7. Motivation and Reasons for Choosing the Algorithm
*	CNNs: Well-suited for image data as they can capture spatial hierarchies in images through convolutional layers.
*	Keras: Provides a user-friendly interface for building and training deep learning models.
